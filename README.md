# Procedural 2D Dungeon Generation

## Overview ##
The Dungeon Generation Algorithm takes inspiration from probability theory to introduce an element of unpredictability and complexity into your dungeon environments. By leveraging probabilistic principles, I have crafted a tool that goes beyond traditional methods, offering a dynamic and ever-changing canvas for game worlds.

My project has been created with the C++ Win32 Engine developed by my teacher at University of Applied Science Howest.

I am also using a small visual techique to show that all the room and corridors in the dungeon are walkable by adding enter and exit points to my visual representation.

## Key Features ##

-Probabilistic Room Placement: Utilize probability distributions to determine where rooms are likely to appear within the dungeon, creating diverse and unpredictable spatial arrangements.

-Adaptive Corridor Generation: Apply probability-based decisions to the formation of corridors, introducing organic connections between rooms with varying likelihoods.

-Feature-Rich Dungeons: Employ probability to generate dungeon features. For now there are only rooms and corridors, but also some hidded paths or treasure rooms can be added to the dungeon.

-Flexible Room Characteristics: Use probability distributions to influence the size and shape of rooms, resulting in visually engaging layouts with a mix of large and small spaces.

-Grid-Based Activation: Implement probability-based activation of tiles or cells in grid-based systems.
