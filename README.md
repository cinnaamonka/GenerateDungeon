# Procedural 2D Dungeon Generation

## Overview ##
The Dungeon Generation Algorithm takes inspiration from probability theory to introduce an element of unpredictability and complexity into your dungeon environments. By leveraging probabilistic principles, I have crafted a tool that goes beyond traditional methods, offering a dynamic and ever-changing canvas for game worlds.

My project has been created with the C++ Win32 Engine developed by my teacher at University of Applied Science Howest.

I am also using a small visual techique to show that all the room and corridors in the dungeon are walkable by adding enter and exit points to my visual representation.
